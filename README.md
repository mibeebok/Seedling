## General Information
There was a Player in a big bustling city. He always dreamed of living in nature, away from the hustle and bustle of city streets. One day, after many years of living in the city, he decided to return to his native home, which his family had left in the childhood of the Protagonist. The player was tired of city life and wanted to change his fate.
When he arrived, he was greeted by a picture full of nostalgia: a cozy house with a well-groomed roof, but the vegetable garden and garden were in a neglected state. This place held many memories of his childhood, and the Player felt that he could start a new life here.
